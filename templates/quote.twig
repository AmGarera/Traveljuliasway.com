<div class="grey-background quote-padding" style="padding-top: 200px">One thing I've learned after being in the business for just a short time is that I really
    do know what I'm doing,
    and I'm really good at it! Accordingly, my time and experience are valuable, and it's good for you to know that
    up-front what you may be facing on top of the costs for your trip (if any!).
