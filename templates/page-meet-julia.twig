        A little bit about me?  I am a French major & International MBA grad that loves Europe, history, food and wine.  I’m a bit of a movie dork, and love classic literature too.  My favorite thing is planning great days in dream destinations for my clients.  I don’t love mass market, large ship cruising, all-inclusive resorts, or cookie cutter, generic travel packages.  If you are going to travel halfway around the world, I don’t want you sitting in some line filled with tourists.  I will not only get you there with ease, I will expose you to the most incredible experiences and highlights of your chosen destination leaving you with memories you will cherish forever.
