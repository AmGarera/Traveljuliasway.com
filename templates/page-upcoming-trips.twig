    <div>The best way to experience what I mean when I say "Travel Julia's Way" is to travel WITH me! I'll continually update this space with opportunities for you to join me on upcoming trips, and also to let you know where you might be able to meet me during some of my independent travels.  Of course, if you have a trip you & friends want to take, but want an expert to help plan & travel along with you - let me know!! </div>
